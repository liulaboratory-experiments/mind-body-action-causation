## Code
This folder contains the R analysis scripts for study 1 and study 2. Each study folder contains an `.Rmd` analysis file with a knitted `.html` report, a data folder (`/data/`), a figure folder with figures used in the manuscript (`/figures/`), and a couple of intermediate files created by the analysis scripts (i.e. `snapshots_study1_pre-processing_analysis` and `snapshots_study1_final_analysis`. 

## Docs
This folder contains the experimental stimuli. Both experiments was implemented using jsPsych, and are available at the html files `study1.html`, `study2_inference.html` and `study2_intervention.html`. The `/images`, `video`, and `/jspsych` folders contain supporting materials for the experiments.
