## Code
This folder contains the R analysis scripts for study 1 and study 2. Each study folder contains an `.Rmd` analysis file with a knitted `.html` report, a data subfolder (`/data/`), a figures subfolder with figures used in the manuscript (`/figures/`), and some subfolders containing intermediate files created by the analysis scripts (i.e. `snapshots_study1_preprocessing_analysis` and `snapshots_study1_final_analysis`. 

Feel free to download the repository (button on top right) and look through the files. If you would like to quickly view the analysis report, you can download just the .html report for the corresponding study, and double-click to open it on your browser (i.e. go to `/code/study1/` and download `/study1_analysis.html`). 

## Docs
This folder contains the experimental stimuli. Both experiments was implemented using jsPsych, and are available at the html files `docs/study1.html`, `docs/study2_inference.html` and `docs/study2_intervention.html`. The `/images`, `video`, and `/jspsych` folders contain supporting materials for the experiments. 

Thank you for accessing these materials!
